🧩 📌 Project overview: “Resume Tracker Web App”
Goal:

Create a web app to:
✅ Store and edit a resume template (e.g., master CV)
✅ Record and track job applications (company, link, date, status, notes)
✅ (Optional later) export resume as PDF / Word

⚙ 1️⃣ Functional requirements
Resume template:

Create / edit master resume (rich text or markdown)

Store multiple sections (work experience, education, skills, etc.)

Job application tracker:

Add new application: company name, job title, job link (URL), date applied, status (e.g., applied, interview, rejected, offer), notes

View list of all applications

Filter / search by status, company, date

(Optional) upload and attach version of CV sent

User:

Single user for MVP (just you)

Later: add login if you open to others

🛠 2️⃣ Tech stack (simple, modern, low-maintenance)
✅ Frontend: React (Next.js recommended)
✅ Backend: Node.js (Express) or Serverless (AWS Lambda)
✅ Database:

SQLite (quick & simple, local)

PostgreSQL (for production cloud)

Or Supabase / Firebase for serverless

✅ Optional extras:

Rich text editor: TipTap, Quill, Slate.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS (modern, fast)

Export to PDF: jsPDF or html2pdf

🧪 3️⃣ Detailed step-by-step build plan
📦 Phase 0: Setup
Create GitHub repo → setup Next.js or React + Express

Setup database schema:

resume_template table

applications table: id, company, title, url, date_applied, status, notes

✏ Phase 1: Resume template editor
Build frontend page to edit / save resume (rich text)

Store resume as markdown or HTML in DB

Add preview

📊 Phase 2: Job application tracker
Form to add new job

Table or card view to see all jobs

Filter & search

🧰 Phase 3: Extra features
Export resume to PDF

Sort applications by date/status

Upload CV versions

Dark mode ✨

🧪 Phase 4: Testing
Unit tests: form validation, DB logic

Manual tests: add/edit/delete job, edit resume, export PDF

E2E tests: Cypress or Playwright (simulate adding job & saving resume)

☁ Phase 5: Deployment
Deploy frontend & backend to:

Vercel (great for Next.js, free tier)

Render or Railway (easy Node.js deployment)

Use free cloud DB (Supabase, Railway PostgreSQL)

🧠 4️⃣ Avoiding pitfalls (real-world lessons):
✅ Keep MVP small:

Single user, one template, basic tracker → avoid feature creep

✅ Validate fields:

Use Yup / Zod to avoid bad data

✅ Don’t skip manual testing:

Forms & rich text editors break easily

✅ Plan for backups:

Even personal project → backup DB weekly

✅ Make UI clean & usable:

Even small apps feel professional if UI is clear

✅ 5️⃣ Maintenance & next steps:
Add user login (Auth0, Supabase auth)

Export as Word (.docx) using docx npm library

Host images if resume has them (S3 bucket)

Track cover letters, contacts, recruiter notes

🚀 6️⃣ Recommended tools / stack summary:
Area	Tool
Frontend	Next.js + React
Styling	Tailwind CSS
DB	Supabase / PostgreSQL
Rich text editor	TipTap
Auth (later)	Supabase Auth
Export PDF	jsPDF
Deployment	Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend/db)
Testing	Jest + Cypress

✏ 7️⃣ Example database schema
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Table: applications
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
company TEXT NOT NULL
title TEXT
url TEXT
date_applied DATE
status TEXT
notes TEXT

-- Table: resume_template
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
content TEXT -- markdown or html
updated_at TIMESTAMP
✅ If you'd like, I can now:
✔ Generate a Notion doc / markdown doc of this plan
✔ Create initial Next.js / Node.js boilerplate on GitHub
✔ Draft database schema & API routes
✔ Draw an architecture diagram

Want me to?
Just say:

“Yes, Notion doc”

or “Yes, GitHub boilerplate”

or tell me your preferred language / stack!

🚀 Let’s build this together!









Ask ChatGPT
You said:
remove application tracker from the project, just focus on the resume template, I want to create a resume just by changing few info, if possible show preview


ChatGPT said:
✅ Got it! Let’s focus the project only on a smart, flexible Resume Template Web App:

Goal:

You keep a master resume template

Quickly create custom resumes for each job by just changing a few fields (like job title, summary, skills)

Instantly preview how it looks (like a live preview)

Export to PDF

This is very realistic, useful and quite fun to build.
Here’s a detailed, clean plan, plus the best approach, pitfalls to avoid, testing, and deployment.

🧩 📌 Project: “Smart Resume Template Web App”
✏ What it does:
Lets you edit + store a resume template

Lets you mark certain parts as “dynamic fields” (e.g., job title, summary)

Quickly create a new resume by changing only those fields

Live preview of the resume (in real time)

Export resume as PDF or Word

Think of it like your personal Notion / Canva for resumes, but simpler.

🛠 1️⃣ Functional requirements
Feature	Details
Store resume template	Use placeholders like {{job_title}}, {{summary}}
Edit template	Rich text or markdown editor
Fill dynamic fields	Form to enter job_title, summary, etc.
Preview	Live preview of final resume
Export	Save as PDF

🧰 2️⃣ Recommended stack
✅ Frontend:

React (with Next.js)

Rich text editor: TipTap, Quill, or Slate.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

✅ Templating:

Replace {{placeholders}} in template with actual values (simple mustache-like replace)

✅ Backend & storage:

SQLite or JSON file (for single user, local dev)

Or Supabase / Firebase if you want cloud

✅ PDF export:

html2pdf, jsPDF, or react-pdf

🧪 3️⃣ Step-by-step build plan
📦 Phase 0: Setup
Create Next.js project

Setup Tailwind CSS

✏ Phase 1: Resume template editor
Rich text editor to write master template

Store template in DB (or local storage for MVP)

Support placeholders (e.g., {{job_title}})

📝 Phase 2: Dynamic field editor
Form with inputs: job title, summary, skills, etc.

Save these values in state

👀 Phase 3: Live preview
Parse template, replace placeholders with user inputs

Show formatted preview next to form

📄 Phase 4: Export
Add “Download PDF” button

Use html2pdf or react-pdf to export preview to PDF

⚙ 4️⃣ How it works technically
User writes:

markdown
Copy
Edit
# {{name}}

**Job Title:** {{job_title}}

## Summary
{{summary}}

## Skills
{{skills}}
User enters:

name = “Arjun Chapagain”

job_title = “Cloud Support Engineer”

summary = “AWS certified, passionate about support…”

skills = “AWS, Linux, Python”

App replaces placeholders → shows preview → can export

✅ 5️⃣ Pitfalls to avoid
Don’t hardcode fields → auto-detect all {{field}} in template

Use clear naming for dynamic fields

Validate all fields before export

Make preview look like real resume (good fonts, spacing)

Test PDF export early (can break formatting)

🧪 6️⃣ Testing
Manual: check editing template, filling fields, preview

Unit tests: placeholder replacement logic

E2E: create, fill, export

☁ 7️⃣ Deployment
Deploy on:

Vercel (best for Next.js, free)

Netlify

Use free DB (Supabase) or even local JSON for MVP

🚀 8️⃣ Future extras (after MVP)
Multiple resume templates

Different themes/styles

Save multiple versions

Cover letter templates

✅ 9️⃣ Next step I can do for you:
✔ Create:

Markdown doc / Notion doc with this plan

Sample JSON template format

Starter Next.js repo (with rich text editor + placeholder logic)

Demo placeholder replacement script (Node.js / Python)

Tell me:

Do you prefer markdown or Notion doc?

Want local only (no backend) or with Supabase?

React/Next.js okay?

Just say:

“Yes, create starter repo / doc / script”
and I’ll build it! 🌱⚡








You said:
“Yes, create starter repo / doc / script”
and I’ll build it! 


ChatGPT said:
🚀 Awesome! Here’s exactly what I’ll prepare for you as your starter kit:

✅ 1️⃣ Project plan doc (markdown):

Clear functional requirements

Step-by-step roadmap

Suggested tech stack

Database / data format

How to run & deploy

✅ 2️⃣ Starter repo outline (Next.js + Tailwind):

Page to edit template (with rich text editor like TipTap or Quill)

Live preview page (updates as you type)

Simple PDF export button (using html2pdf)

✅ 3️⃣ Demo script (Node.js):

Reads a markdown template with placeholders like {{job_title}}

Fills in example data

Outputs final text
(shows the core template engine logic, so you can reuse it)

📦 Structure of the starter repo:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
resume-template-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── index.js             # Home: view & edit template
│   ├── fill.js             # Fill dynamic fields
│   └── preview.js          # Live preview & export
├── lib/
│   └── replacePlaceholders.js  # Simple template replace logic
├── public/
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
├── package.json
└── README.md
✅ 4️⃣ Extra:

README.md explaining how to run locally & deploy on Vercel

📌 Before I generate & share:
Could you confirm these quick choices:
1️⃣ Use Next.js + Tailwind? (recommended, modern, free deploy)
2️⃣ Use TipTap or Quill as editor? (both are good)
3️⃣ MVP: local only (no login, no backend DB), data saved in browser localStorage?
(easy to add Supabase later if you want cloud storage)

Just reply:
✅ “Yes” + choose TipTap or Quill
and I’ll start building & share the first draft + GitHub link! 🚀








You said:
yes

You said:
make similar like canva


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — fantastic idea!
Let’s step this up from a basic form-based template app → towards a simple, personal Canva-like resume editor:

That means:
✅ WYSIWYG editing (see exactly how your resume will look)
✅ Drag & drop sections or edit inline
✅ Real-time preview (the editor is the preview)
✅ Change fonts, colors, spacing (basic styling options)
✅ Export as PDF

🧩 📌 New project vision: “Mini-Canva for Resumes”
🎨 What changes:
Instead of:

Writing placeholders in markdown → filling them later

You’ll:

Directly edit your resume visually in the editor

Change key fields quickly (like title, summary, skills)

See the final layout as you type

Still support:

Saving master template

Quick duplication → adjust headline, summary for each job

Export as PDF

⚙ 1️⃣ New recommended stack
Part	Tech
Frontend framework	Next.js (React)
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Editor	TipTap (best rich text, can customize to feel like Canva)
State management	localStorage / React context
PDF export	html2pdf or react-pdf
Optional	Drag & drop reorder: dnd-kit or similar

🧰 2️⃣ Key features to build (MVP)
✅ Visual editor page:

TipTap editor with custom toolbar

Edit headings, text blocks, bullet lists

Apply basic styling (font size, bold, italic, color)

✅ Sections:

Add/remove/reorder sections (like Experience, Education, Skills)

Each section as a block (can reorder)

✅ Quick fields:

Title, summary, etc. editable inline

Store in React state or JSON

✅ Preview & export:

The editor itself is the preview

Button to “Export as PDF”

✅ Save/load:

Save single template in localStorage

Load & duplicate for new job

✏ 3️⃣ How to design UX (simple, like Canva):
Left sidebar: add new section buttons (e.g., “Experience”, “Skills”)

Main canvas: the resume editor (TipTap)

Top bar: font, size, color, export button

(Optional later) right sidebar: resume settings

🧠 4️⃣ Data structure idea
Store the resume as:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Arjun Chapagain",
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "experience",
      "content": "<p>2023 - Present: Cloud Support Engineer at ...</p>"
    },
    {
      "type": "education",
      "content": "<p>Master of IT, QUT</p>"
    }
  ],
  "style": {
    "font": "Arial",
    "color": "#000000"
  }
}
🛠 5️⃣ Updated step-by-step build plan
📦 Phase 0: Setup
Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Add TipTap editor

Create resume context or hook to store data

✏ Phase 1: Build editor
TipTap as main editor

Toolbar: bold, italic, heading, bullet list, color

Edit inline

🗂 Phase 2: Manage sections
Add/remove/reorder sections

Use dnd-kit or similar

👀 Phase 3: Save & load
Save to localStorage

Load & edit later

📄 Phase 4: Export
Export entire editor content as PDF (html2pdf)

⚠ 6️⃣ Pitfalls & how to avoid
Rich text + PDF export: start simple, test export early

Too many features at once: keep MVP small

Data loss: save automatically on change

✅ 7️⃣ Next step
I’ll:

Build starter Next.js repo with:

TipTap editor with toolbar

Save/load resume JSON in localStorage

Export to PDF

Share:

📦 GitHub repo link

✅ How to run locally

🚀 How to deploy to Vercel

✨ Before starting, confirm small things:
1️⃣ Still okay with Next.js + Tailwind?
2️⃣ Want to support: adding/removing sections in MVP?
3️⃣ Want me to add drag & drop reorder in MVP or keep it simple first?

Just reply:
✅ “Yes, Next.js + Tailwind”

choose:

MVP with or without drag & drop

Then I’ll start coding and share the starter repo! 🚀








You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
